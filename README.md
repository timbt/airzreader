airzreader
==========

A web app to display the stories of Reddit user airz23. Right now it load up some of the more recent stories in minimalistic form on one big page.

The end goal is basically a nice looking RSS feed reader web app (tailored of course to the stories of the afformentioned Reddit user.) It's built on Node.js using the express and feedparser packages from NPM. I may eventually try to make it more modular/reusable for other similar purposes.

TODO:
-Back-end improvements (such as properly caching the obtained feeds.)
-Decide on a templating/rendering strategy.
-Make stories viewable one at at a time.
-Basically the whole front-end of this thing.
